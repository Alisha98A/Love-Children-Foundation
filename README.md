#Welcome to ![Love Children Foundation](https://alisha98a.github.io/Love-Children-Foundation/)

Love Children Foundation is a website that hopes to give people awareness about the poor/homeless children in Africa. With a proper website, we hope to give the audience all the information they need about our organisation and what we do for these children. The site will be targeted toward all kinds of people, that wants to help us with donation, funding or by volunteering at our orphanage in Africa. Our website will be useful for companies and people of all ages to easy navigate through our site, to quickly learn who we are and what we do, and also get information about what they themselves can do.

The reason for doing a website for Love Children Foundation is to give easy accessibility for people who wants to know more about our organisation. I chose this subject because I myself been helping other orphanages with money, and I’ve also visited many orphanages around Thailand. The organisation I’ve created now, is not located in Thailand. However, it’s the same issue in Africa. Therefore, I really wanted to create a website for Love Children Organisation because I’m super passionate about helping other people, and specifically children with poor background.

## Features

The first step was to structure everything out using Figma. Since my website is about children, I thought of having a colorful website. And since I want a very simple and basic site, I’m only using two main colors: orange and light blue. The layout is simple, with the logo (Love Children Foundation) to the top left and navigation bar menu to the right.  
Directly under navigation bar menu, we have a big picture of some happy African kids. I chose this image because it represents what the whole website Is about - children, and specifically African children. On the picture, we can see kids that are smiling towards the camera. They look happy.

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**

  - Featured on all 6 pages (including 404 and thank you page). The navigation bar is responsive & include links to Logo, About Us, Our Projects & Support Us page.

### Features Left to Implement

    -  What I wanted to add since beginning was a map in the footer to show the location to the (made up) orphanage. But since it would require JavaScript, which I will not be graded on. I decided to let that idea go for now.
    -  If I had time, I would like to display the scrollable content better. I don't know exactly how, but I would have displayed the text and images so it had better variety of positions, using something called Flexbox to move elements around in different ways. Right now, my scrollable content is in the same order on all three pages (with different text and images of course). There is nothing wrong with the displaying right now, I would just have made it look more organised and fun if I had more time.

## Testing

### Overview:

The importance of testing is to ensure that the project has the quality of a software product. Validation is a confirmation that the project meets the requirements. It's also important to test to see if you have any bugs in your code, in that case, it might be good to solve them before releasing it. Another thing is that your website/app or whatever your'e developing, is going to be seen from different devices and screens after release. Testing is therefore good to see if your project performs well under various conditions and loads.

### Testing Methodology: 

For this project, I've used Lighthouse, W3C Validator and Jigsaw validator. 

### Feature Testing:

- **Lighthouse**

I simply click Inspect when I double click on page, go to the double arrow to the top right and run my page through Lighthouse. The tool gives you recommendations on how to improve page performance (Performance Optimization), accessibility issues, best practice recommendations, improving your site's performance, and fast page loads. 

Lighthouse has helped me address problems early on, which I've tried to solve. I had to work a lot on my images, to get them resized in different dimensions, and also think of responsiveness, high resolution and fast loads. I started with one image, but thanks to Lighthouse and my mentor, I got to understand how I should upload files and what works best for better user experience. This resulted in uploading 4 different sizes of images, of the same image. To use them in different media queries. I converted 3 of the images to WebP, and saved one in JPG for a fallback image, in case some browser don't support WebP. The images containing a lot of data for example 1916x849 pixel, will be displayed on screens that are larger than 1200px. While the same image but with 618x274px instead, will be used for smaller screen devices. This improves both better resolution of image displayed (higher quality) and faster loads, which is a win win for the user experience. 

Another problem I encountered was my list structure for the "Support Us" section at the bottom, I did not have any problem with it before. But after putting an anchor tag 
link outside my list and inside my ul (containing the list), my structure got broken. I got help from tutor team with this, helping me put my a href tag right and changing span to div because it would be displayed better then. I got help to wrap anchor tag inside li element correctly.

- **W3C Validator**
- 
The most errors I got from here was that I had to remove trailing slashes on void elements. After removing them on all pages, the issue was solved. 
	

- **Jigsaw validator**
I got one error of my paragraph id for media query of 768px and up, where I missed to set a value to font-size, after setting a value to px. The issue was solved.


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](x)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Falisha98a.github.io%2FLove-Children-Foundation%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found here - https://code-institute-org.github.io/love-running-2.0/index.html

## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

### Content

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site
- The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site
- (Remove this after re-writing)
  Notes on what I've done until rewriting this:
  Media query applied to navbar and logo, credits to Code Institute where in Love running project, showed me how to apply media query.
  Added title with favicon footsteps to represent kids. Link -> https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/footprints
  Added metatags with keywords related to homepage

Changed font-family style with Google Fonts. Link -->
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope?preview.text=Love%20Children%20Foundation

Copied screen size max width responsive from Love Running project. Is it okay or should I remove?

challenges: to make section 2 look good at different screen sizes.

didn't manage to make images in project section display better when bigger screen size than 992px (wanted bigger and more space between)
didn't get "change the world with us" text at the homepage image fit when smaller screen size.

change video size from 768px and up, didn't manage to make the change. It must be larger - solved this 24/1 by removing max-width on line 255. Got help from Tutoring session.
text-video next to video is a link? - solved this 24/1 by closing a tag, now it's no link anymore
make video section look better at bigger screen sizes
change button link so its the same size for every button at every media query
failed with making list in volunteer section centered from 768px and up.
cannot add margin top to media query of 768px and higher when i want to target learn-more-buttom
volunteer button, cannot move more right in media query of 768px and up

VIDEO BUTTON from 630px and higher doesn't move. Something is blocking. I want it inline with video.
PROJECT BUTTON on 1228px and higher needs to be positioned more up, right now its outisde of section. FIX THIS
SAME BUTTON needs to be centered on 280px and up
VIDEO SECTION needs to be fixed from 630px and up. FIX THIS

VIDEO BUTTON NEEDS MORE SPACE from 280px FIX THIS
VIDEO NEEDS TO BE CENTERED FROM 480PX, when i add width. It's not centered anymore
Too much space at the top from 630px and up in video section
FROM 992PX AND UP, VIDEO IS NOT SHOWING FULL HEIGHT
added flexbox to list for bigger screens, but it didn't work
Project button from 768px and above has an absolute positioning, line 661. Therefore, it moves when screen gets bigger

SOLVING:
Video section, had trouble with positioning of elements. Tried different methods but finally solved it by having 2 divs, 1 for header and text and one for video and button. Also removed my position absolute from iframe because it blocked so my button could'nt move. By removing it, I could position my button where I wanted again. I got help from tutoring team on this one.
Add tabindex="0" attribute to each anchor (<a>), links becomes focusable programmatically by keyboard navigation. When a user tabs through the page elements, these links will receive focus, making them accessible without relying on JavaScript event handlers like onmouseover() or onmouseout(). Lighthouse warned me of that.

credits:
I was stuck on video section. Elements didn't move. With help from John on tutoring team, I got help to move iframe inside of video container div. So that I could target all three elements (video, text and button) into position:flex;. Before, iframe container was outside of video container div.

This website, got here from devtools lighthouse. Helped me understand more about images and that by converting them from JPG to WebP or AVIV format, the images will load faster.

This link above was a good reference for what aspect ratio the image should be in.

Responsive youtube code adapted from avexdesigns.com/blog/responsive-youtube-embed
Used display=swap to ensure the text is displayed using a fallback font until the custom font is loaded. From https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/font-display/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools. Did not put this in css though, i moved it from css into html instead for better control.

LIGHTHOUSE FIXES
Currently in the header you have an input element, then a label element for the input that has a font awesome icon in it. That means a screen reader doesn't know what the checkbox input element is for as the label is empty, here you can't use an aria-label though so we need a different approach. You can fix this by putting a span element inside the label next to the icon, then inside the span you can put the text 'toggle menu' and give it a class of sr-only if you have a look at this article, it explains how to hide the text using that sr-only class, it also gives you the css code you need to hide it. Don't forget to credit it in your readme.
