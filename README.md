#Welcome to ![Love Children Foundation](file:///Users/alishaandersson/Desktop/Love-Children-Foundation/index.html)

Love Children Foundation is a website that hopes to give people awareness about the poor/homeless children in Africa. With a proper website, we hope to give the audience all the information they need about our organisation and what we do for these children. The site will be targeted toward all kinds of people, that wants to help us with donation, funding or by volunteering at our orphanage in Africa. Our website will be useful for companies and people of all ages to easy navigate through our site, to quickly learn who we are and what we do, and also get information about what they themselves can do.

The reason for doing a website for Love Children Foundation is to give easy accessibility for people who wants to know more about our organisation. I chose this subject because I myself been helping other orphanages with money, and I’ve also visited many orphanages around Thailand. The organisation I’ve created now, is not located in Thailand. However, it’s the same issue in Africa. Therefore, I really wanted to create a website for Love Children Organisation because I’m super passionate about helping other people, and specifically children with poor background.

The first step was to structure everything out using Figma. Since my website is about children, I thought of having a colorful website. And since I want a very simple and basic site, I’m only using two main colors: orange and light blue. The layout is simple, with the logo (Love Children Foundation) to the top left and navigation bar menu to the right. I also added Instagram and Facebook icon to the right that links to www.instagram.com and www.facebook.com. Since I created a website with a non existing organisation, the links goes to facebook and instagram homepage. Due to the fact that I don’t have a real organisation, and therefore cannot link to real accounts.
Directly under navigation bar menu, we have a big picture of some happy African kids. I chose this image because it represents what the whole website Is about - children, and specifically African children. On the picture, we can see kids that are smiling towards the camera. They look happy.

Added title with favicon footsteps to represent kids. Link -> https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/footprints
Added metatags with keywords related to homepage

Copied screen size max width responsive from Love Running project. Is it okay or should I remove?

challenges: to make section 2 look good at different screen sizes.

didn't manage to make images in project section display better when bigger screen size than 992px (wanted bigger and more space between)
didn't get "change the world with us" text at the homepage image fit when smaller screen size.

change video size from 768px and up, didn't manage to make the change. It must be larger - solved this 24/1 by removing max-width on line 255. Got help from Tutoring session.
