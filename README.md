Welcome to ![Love Children Foundation](file:///Users/alishaandersson/Desktop/Love-Children-Foundation/index.html)

Love Children Foundation is a website that hopes to give people awareness about the poor/homeless children in Africa. With a proper website, we hope to give the audience all the information they need about our organisation and what we do for these children. The site will be targeted toward all kinds of people, that wants to help us with donation, funding or by volunteering at our orphanage in Africa. Our website will be useful for companies and people of all ages to easy navigate through our site, to quickly learn who we are and what we do, and also get information about what they themselves can do.



Notes on what I've done until rewriting this:
Media query applied to navbar and logo, credits to Code Institute where in Love running project, showed me how to apply media query.
