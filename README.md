# Welcome to [Love Children Foundation](https://alisha98a.github.io/Love-Children-Foundation/)

Love Children Foundation is a website that hopes to give people awareness about the poor/homeless children in Africa. With a proper website, we hope to give the audience all the information they need about our organisation and what we do for these children. The site will be targeted toward all kinds of people, that wants to help us with donation, funding or by volunteering at our orphanage in Africa. Our website will be useful for companies and people of all ages to easy navigate through our site, to quickly learn who we are and what we do, and also get information about what they themselves can do.

The reason for doing a website for Love Children Foundation is to give easy accessibility for people who wants to know more about our organisation. I chose this subject because I myself been helping other orphanages with money, and I’ve also visited many orphanages around Thailand. The organisation I’ve created now, is not located in Thailand. However, it’s the same issue in Africa. Therefore, I really wanted to create a website for Love Children Organisation because I’m super passionate about helping other people, and specifically children with poor background.

## Features

The first step was to structure everything out using Figma. Since my website is about children, I thought of having a colorful website. And since I want a very simple and basic site, I’m only using two main colors: orange and light blue. The layout is simple, with the logo (Love Children Foundation) to the top left and navigation bar menu to the right.  
Directly under navigation bar menu, we have a big picture of some happy African kids. I chose this image because it represents what the whole website Is about - children, and specifically African children. On the picture, we can see kids that are smiling towards the camera. They look happy.

### Existing Features

Before the icons, you see a text that says "Where you can find us" which makes it clear that the icon links are connected to our Facebook and Instagram page. However, since this is a project about a non existing organisation, I have linked the icons to www.facebook.com and www.instagram.com for now, which is the homepage of Facebook and Instagram.
  - When you hover over social media icons, icon changes color. This for the user to know that it's a link. Which is good for user experience.

- **Anchor tags**
  - My anchor tags on all page content has no underline for a cleaner structure, instead they have a styling so that when you hover over, the link gets bigger. Only exception is on menubar.

### Features Left to Implement

    -  What I wanted to add since beginning was a map in the footer to show the location to the (made up) orphanage. But since it would require JavaScript, which I will not be graded on. I decided to let that idea go for now.
    -  If I had time, I would like to display the scrollable content better. I don't know exactly how, but I would have displayed the text and images so it had better variety of positions, using something called Flexbox to move elements around in different ways. Right now, my scrollable content is in the same order on all three pages (with different text and images of course). There is nothing wrong with the displaying right now, I would just have made it look more fun if I really put my focus to it. Overall, testing is good to ensure reliability and functionality of my project.
    - I would also make the Support Us contact form fully functional by recieving and collecting data from the users who submit. 
    - More information on the landing page (first page) for better content, by adding quotes and other types of text.
 

## Testing

Details about testing is referred to a seperate document called TESTING.md file
![Testing ](https://github.com/Alisha98A/Love-Children-Foundation/blob/main/TESTING.md)

### Unfixed Bugs
- Didn't get "change the world with us" text at the homepage image to fit when smaller screen size. It didn't look good, so I removed it completely because it was not important to have it. 
- 

make video section look better at bigger screen sizes
change button link so its the same size for every button at every media query
failed with making list in volunteer section centered from 768px and up.
cannot add margin top to media query of 768px and higher when i want to target learn-more-buttom
volunteer button, cannot move more right in media query of 768px and up
VIDEO BUTTON from 630px and higher doesn't move. Something is blocking. I want it inline with video.
PROJECT BUTTON on 1228px and higher needs to be positioned more up, right now its outisde of section. FIX THIS
SAME BUTTON needs to be centered on 280px and up
VIDEO SECTION needs to be fixed from 630px and up. FIX THIS
Project button from 768px and above has an absolute positioning, line 661. Therefore, it moves when screen gets bigger

VIDEO BUTTON NEEDS MORE SPACE from 280px FIX THIS
VIDEO NEEDS TO BE CENTERED FROM 480PX, when i add width. It's not centered anymore
Too much space at the top from 630px and up in video section
FROM 992PX AND UP, VIDEO IS NOT SHOWING FULL HEIGHT
added flexbox to list for bigger screens, but it didn't work

## Credits

### General reference
- This project was influenced by Love Running, a code-along project from Code Institute. By trying to understand the underlying principles I have tried to adapt them to my own project. However, this might involve using similar container elements, semantic tags etc.
- I relied very much upon Code Institute's learning material, together with MDN and W3Schools.
- Code Institute Slack Community has also been a big support.
- A specific THANKS to [Matt Bodden](https://github.com/MattBCoding) who helped me through this journey. I would not be here without him!
- Tutoring team on Code Institute has also been there for me with providing me materials and articles for understanding the project.
- I've used [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) for explanation over things I needed more clarification in.

### Content
  - All fonts imported from - Google Fonts
  - Media query applied to navbar and logo, credits to Code Institute where in Love running project, showed me how to apply media query.
  - Video section, had trouble with positioning of elements. Tried different methods but finally solved it by having 2 divs, 1 for header and text and one for video and button. Also removed my position absolute from iframe because it blocked so my button could'nt move. By removing it, I could position my button where I wanted again. I got help from tutoring team on this one.
  - I was stuck on video section. Elements didn't move. With help from John on tutoring team, I got help to move iframe inside of video container div. So that I could target all three elements (video, text and button) into position:flex;. Before, iframe container was outside of video container div.
  - [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) helped me with different types of input types, together with Learn Code Institute.
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp) helped me understand how hyperlinks works which I applied to the logo, to link to homepage.
  - [Developer Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-webp-images/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools) website helped me understand more about images and that by converting them from JPG to WebP or AVIV format, the images will load faster.
https://tiny-img.com/blog/best-image-size-for-website/
  - [Eksposure](https://www.eksposure.com/4-3-vs-16-9-aspect-ratio/) website was a good reference for what aspect ratio the image should be in.
  - Responsive youtube code adapted from [Avexdesigns](avexdesigns.com/blog/responsive-youtube-embed).
  - Used display=swap to ensure the text is displayed using a fallback font until the custom font is loaded. From [Developer Chrome Article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/font-display/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools). Did not put this in css though, i moved it from css into html instead for better control.
  - Hide text using the sr-only class from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/inclusively-hidden/) and with help from [Matt Bodden](https://github.com/MattBCoding)
  - [Aria label] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label source for putting aria label to my social media icons)
  - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ ) and[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) for linking in my footer.
  - Add tabindex="0" attribute to each anchor (<a>). https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex
  - Compressed homepage image to save data, with the help from Holly at Tutoring team.
